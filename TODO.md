# My thoughts

What I need from ORM?
* been an engine agnostic (with additional drivers)
* start as application, connect to DB 
* generate and load .erl and .beam files for all collections
* if there are no collection, generate it on first writing attempt (lazy creation)
* seamless creation of relations
